# Current State of Randomizer Project

**Date:** June 27, 2025

**Problem:**
The `npm test` command is consistently failing with an "Error: Failed to parse source for import analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax" in `src/main.js`. This error specifically points to the import of `RandomizerEngine.js` within `src/main.js`.

**Actions Taken So Far:**

1.  **Moved `RandomizerEngine.js`:** Moved `RandomizerEngine.js` from the project root to `src/RandomizerEngine.js` to better organize the codebase.
2.  **Updated Import Paths:** Attempted to correct import paths in `src/main.js` and various test files (`tests/app.init.spec.js`, `tests/persist-init.test.js`, `tests/uiReadablePrompt.test.js`) to reflect the new location of `RandomizerEngine.js`. This included trying both relative paths (`../src/RandomizerEngine.js`) and aliased paths (`@/RandomizerEngine.js`).
3.  **Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json`:** Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` to explicitly declare the project as an ES module, which often resolves import-related issues in Node.js environments.
4.  **Recreated Failing Test Files:** Deleted and recreated `tests/app.init.spec.js`, `tests/persist-init.test.js`, and `tests/uiReadablePrompt.test.js` with simplified content and corrected relative import paths to rule out any corruption or subtle syntax errors in those files.
5.  **Adjusted `vitest.config.js`:**
    *   Modified the `include` pattern to specifically target `tests/**/*.js` to prevent Vitest from trying to run source files as tests.
    *   Attempted to add `transformMode` to explicitly tell Vitest to process `src/main.js` as a web module, but this led to "Unterminated string literal" errors in `vitest.config.js` itself, indicating a syntax issue in the config. This change was reverted.

**Current Status:**
Despite these efforts, the "invalid JS syntax" error in `src/main.js` persists, always pointing to the `RandomizerEngine` import. The tests continue to fail.

**Next Steps (for the next helper):**
Investigate why `src/main.js` is still causing import errors, specifically focusing on how Vitest/Vite is parsing or transforming `src/main.js` and its imports. It might be a caching issue, a more complex Vitest configuration requirement for mixed module types, or an interaction with other dependencies.
